            <p class="bodytext">
                My name is Joshua Kotter.
                I currently work as a Joining Engineer for Ford Motor Company.
                I attended the University of Louisville and graduated thrice:
                <ul class="bodytext">2018 - Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering - GPA 4.00</ul>
                <ul class="bodytext">2019 - Masters in Mechanical Engineering - GPA 4.00</ul>
                <ul class="bodytext">2020 - Masters in Business Administration - GPA 3.98</ul>
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
                I have written applications for my work at Ford in Python, VBA, and SQLite.
                I built independent websites using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Wordpress applications.
                I also have experience with C, MATLAB, Labview, PLC Ladder Logic, and CAD programs
                Some of my favorite projects include a capture-the-flag robot, a stock-picking
                web scraper, and a label generator application currently used to label all incoming
                inventory at my Ford Plant.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
                In my spare time, I am training for my black belt test in Niseido Jujitsu, a defensive martial art.
                My more peaceful hobbies include juggling balls, clubs, and knives. To unwind, I 
                play my piano or guitar.
